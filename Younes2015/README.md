Basically the Henry Problem transfered to Navier Stokes flow. The semi-analytical solution obtained with the Fourier-Galerkin method is compared with the model results. 

The model here corresponds to test case I as described in the publication. In accordance with the author, for a higher model precicion the outlet velocity profile is adjusted to $\widetilde{u_{out}} = -0.18174 + 0.09137 y + 0.84642 y^2 + 1.31589 y^3 -1.37525 y^4$. This lowers the mass balance error from being around $3\%$ to around $3.75e-5$.
